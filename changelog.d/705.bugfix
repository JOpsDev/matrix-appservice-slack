Disallowed the accidental behaviour of puppeting two or more Slack accounts from the same team to the same Matrix user. This would cause all puppeting for the
user to stop working. The bridge will now **automatically delete** any puppeted connections which violate this rule. You will be notified via the bridge when
this happens, so you can relink your accounts.
